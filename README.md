# SQL-Murder-Mystery
SQL fun GAME!!

I came to know about this game on Nick Singh 📕🐒, DataLemur 🐒 (Ace the SQL & Data Interview) Learn SQL in 30 days Roadmap.

Here I used SQL Queries includes -

SELECT

WHERE clause

JOINS (multiple tables/ Datasets)

Alias

Aggregate Functions (Count, Sum, AVG, etc.)

PROBLEM:
A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.
